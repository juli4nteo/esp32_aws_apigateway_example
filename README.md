# esp32_aws_apigateway_example
An Arduino example on how to perform a POST to an AWS API Gateway endpoint that requires a signed request.
The example runs on an ESP32 device but should translate easily to other devices.

This example requires the Cryptosuite library for Arduino, which can be found [here](https://github.com/Cathedrow/Cryptosuite).
